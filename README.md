# Microsoft DLR Tutorial by Lionel LaskÃ©

> Create your own language on top of the DLR

> In this article, we are going to use a language derived from JavaScript, MyJScript. JavaScript is interesting because it is a language far from C# and VB.NET but not so complex to write as compiler.

This repo exists so that this valuable tutorial isn't lost to the Internet.
